Multi-variate calculus can be a fickle subject. Besides terrible colour projections on 3-dimensional graphs and strange countour lines, we cannot even properly visualise functions or expressions with dimensionality greater than 3. When students learn about line integrals (a.k.a. path integrals), a problem arises. How do we create interesting integrals for students? The short answer, as the above quote suggests, is that we have two choices, either making boring integrals, which means students don't get the opportunity to be "in the weeds," solving realistic problems, or we choose integrals that work out in such a way that they are difficult to solve by hand (as another MVC teacher put the integral this program was written to solve, "I don't even know where to start with this"). In such situations, it is useful to have a calculator to be able to numerically estimate such integrals. This is such a calculator.

Additionally, this calculator can be used for non-multivariable (though it does require pre-parameterisation such that there is only one input and one output variable in MVC contexts) applications, though admittedly, if you are currently learning single-variable calculus, be honest and do your homework without cheating. It'll help you out a lot, trust me. This program for my MVC class was born out of a single-variable calculus concept, so that's at minimum proof that the concepts covered here are applicable.
